# Input
Users provide city information—name and population—by means of assigned input fields on the interface.


# Process
The program generates a structured city report, checks the input, and handles the data.  Maintaining constant font style, CSS styling guarantees a neat layout with a green header, centered navigation bar, and a light gray container for city details.

# Output
The city's name and population shown in a city report within a structured framework.  The active link is emphasized in the green navigation bar, therefore improving usability.  The disciplined design and styling help to increase visual appeal and readability.
